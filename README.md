# bashbox
bash/shell/CLI toolkit

# Goals
The purpose of this library is to facilitate liquid - moving seamlessly between
systems/containers and having a consistent experience across hosts. This involves:
- Tools (shell, aliases, scripts)
- Certain environment variables
- History persistence

## uber-setup
Install all the tools that I like. 
- shell aliases
- install zsh
- install zsh plugins (histdb, autosuggestions, docker)
- configure zshrc
- configure history & archiving

## exo-history
A virtual exo-cortex - brain dump of ALL commands ever executed 
(sans sensitive ones).
